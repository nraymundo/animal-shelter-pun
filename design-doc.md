## GitHub Repository for your project: 
    https://github.com/nraymundo/animal-shelter-pun

## Project Description: 
    A web app that promotes the adoption of shelter animals to help save animals and also help potentially mitigate the anxiety and boredom Coronavirus has caused by helping users find local shelters and allowing them to easily see what animals can be adopted or fostered 

## Target user base: 
    Younger people quarantining with the ability and means to foster/adopt an animal

## Identified issue use base is facing: 
    People are quarantined in their homes with nothing to do and could possibly be dealing with stress, anxiety, etc due to the current pandemic. Meanwhile, Shelters are closing down due to the Coronavirus pandemic and are in need of people to adopt or foster dogs. 

## Explain how your app is solving your users issue? Why should people use your app? 
    Helps relieve quarantined people of boredness. People are home all day so they have the time to train a new animal. Having an animal during this pandemic could benefit oneâ€™s mental health
